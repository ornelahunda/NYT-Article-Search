# NYT-Article-Search

This is a React-based rendition of the New York Times Article Search application. 
It is built with React components, helper/util functions, and utilizes the React mounting lifecycle to query and display articles based on user searches.
Also uses Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save articles to read later.
